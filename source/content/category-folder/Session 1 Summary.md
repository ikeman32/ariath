Father Aldric a farmer who doubled as a priest of  [Pelor](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=18) entered the tavern after a bell had run and spoke of a woman's body had been found. The party decided to go with the priest to see what happened.

## Scene 2 At the body on the road

At the seen the body of a woman was splayed out and had been hollowed. The scene of the incident had no tracks of any kind other that her own and those that had gathered. The party followed the trail of blood as the towns folk provided no useful clues. The wizard is actually present now and in active play. He the DM decides to retcon the wizard into the game.

## Scene 2.5 fight with something ugly
The party encounters a Huge ugly creature with claws. The Thief wins initiative and the creature is the last to act. The thief fires an arrow and rolls a critical hit. But the arrow seemed ineffective so the thief hides but fails his stealth check.

After everyone had their turn the creature attacked the thief and was successful. The creature rolled max damage and the thief was reduced to zero Hit Points.

The Bard and the Wizard continued the fight and defeated the unknown creature with their spells. The creature when it died melted into the ground and it was as if it was never there.

The Bard then heals the thief and he recovers.

Undulations were found on the ground and the party decides to investigate further by following the  massive snake trail.

## Scene 3 A Massive Snake

Following the undulations made by something massive the party encounters a massively large Black Snake. The party deliberates a few moments and decide to run as the snake decides it's hungry and gives chase. It quickly grows bored and stops chasing the party.

In the area where they encountered the first creatures there was a trail of blood that was glistening in the moon like. Further investigation of the area yield a piece of a note that would later turn out to be magical in some way. The thief collect a sample of the blood for later analysis.  Then the party decided to return to the Dusty Mug.

## Scene 4 Back at the Dusty Mug
Back at the Dusty Mug, Father Aldric and Barlo were arguing about the incident with the woman and Mila was not at the tavern. 

The thief interrupted the argument and recalled what they party had just witness. Father Aldric did not want to believe it and accused the thief and the bard who had joined the conversation of being liars. The turned and walked away.

The wizard decide to cast Detect Magic and the spell was successful and they discovered that the piece of note the thief had with him had magic on it. It was also discover that what ever kind of magic was on the note was also causing Lyra's affliction.

When the thief showed Lyra, who had not stopped babbling since they first arrived at the Dusty Mug all of the sudden stopped and spoke these words:
"The coiled one rises. It's shadow devours the light."

The incident cause Lyra to start leaking blood and ichor.  Father Aldric was called over immediately. After some back and forth the priest showed his hand that he was a coward. The party turned on him and began to berate him for his cowardice, the thief was especially vicious with his words and eventually priest stormed out of the tavern.

The incident with Lyra cause Rollin and his family to leave not wanting to expose their daughter the commotion. All that were left in the tavern were Calda, Lyra, Barlo and the party.

Through the Bard's clever use of minor illusion she was able to replicate the magical note as an illusion so the wizard could make 3 copies of the note.

- The magic on the note may be some sort of divination magic
- In a vision induced by the note some girl was sacrificed and the blood ran into the head of snake
- The symbols on the not appear to be a mixture of dranonnic and abyssal
- A cry for help was heard during one of the incidences with the note
- Visions of snake-like people with forked tongues and a language that sound the the hissing of a snake
- The snake people want to bring back a snake they worship called Mershaulk
- The dagger the wizard saw was wavy like a [flamberge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamberge)
- A woman in robe that vaguely looks like Mila was seen in the vision

The wizard write everything he saw in the vision and draws the dagger, and the symbols off the alter.
