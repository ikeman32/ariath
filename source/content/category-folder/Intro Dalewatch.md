>>You will all have ventured and made your way into The Dusty Mug, a ramshackle inn within Dalewatch.


In the quiet town of Dalewatch, life moves as it always has: steady, simple, and predictable. But beyond the rolling hills and patchwork farms of Yula, rumors of unrest ripple across the land. Noble disputes grow more vicious, ancient traditions are abandoned, and once-harmonious communities now turn on one another. 

To the folk of Dalewatch, these stories feel distant—until now. Strange symbols are found carved into an abandoned barn, and a beloved merchant returns from a trip to the city... changed. He mutters of serpents and golden temples, his once-bright eyes now clouded with fear. 

You’ve come to Dalewatch seeking adventure or perhaps a simple respite. But fate has other plans. Something ancient stirs beneath Yula, a power long forgotten yet never gone. Its influence creeps into every corner, shaping hearts and minds in ways none can see. Whatever has awakened was content to slumber in shadow—until now.
