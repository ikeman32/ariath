## Notes about Transcription
- Players and their characters are indicated by their character class
- The Dungeon Master is indicated by DM
- When quotes (") appear either the character or an NPC played by the DM is speaking, Otherwise the player or DM is speaking
- Verbal pauses (ah, um, etc) are not transcribed
- Long conversations that have very little do with the game are not transcribe they are indicate as [banter]  or [back and forth]
- Profanity is replace with [expletive]
- Some places have and asterisk * , this indicates either a paraphrase because what was said took a long time to say so it was paraphrase to shorten it. In other cases a word was used that in the transcriber's opinion probably would not be said by a character. In bot cases immediately below the transcription will be *: and either the actual word spoken or paraphrased.
- If participants speak over each other then only the one that is understood is transcribed
- If a spot is marked as [unintelligible] that means what the person said could not be understood in the audio.

## Session 1 Scene 1 At the Dusty Mug

DM: You both stumble upon the small farming village of Dalewatch. You guys came in separately for reasons of your own. Within this town the most predominant feature that you both know of is a small terribly constructed tavern called the Dusty Mug. The Dust Mug is as I said a very poorly constructed building. But it's homely, it's cozy. Within you see a small family, a young woman taking care of a seemingly babbling old lady speaking utter nonsense, and  a woman in the corner minding her own business. Of course you see Barlo tending his ales and they hearth, and occasionally walking up to the people.

Just to passive observation, you hear rumors of large snake-like remnants, undulations in the dirt moving through fields. Some even say they found snake skin, though that gets wrote off rather quickly. Out side of that there seems to be something... Off with the setting as if something really isn't right. And that there is your cue.

Bard: Hmm... don’t like that. I'm gonna go over to the bar and sit next to the elf man. I'm gonna ask the bartender for a drink.

DM: Bartender leans over and you notice he is missing four of his fingers on one of his hands. 

Bard: So what's the only one left?

DM: His pointer finger.

Bard: Just one finger... How does he make drinks?

DM: He has another hand.

Bard: Yeah, fair enough. 

DM: He leans over to you and, "What can I get you young lady?"

Bard: Ah, I have a  cider if you have it.

DM: The bartender looks back at you with air of amusement, [Laughs], "I don't know where you fancy folk come from, but we only sell," kinda looks back, "pig swill and horse piss. What do you think this place is?" 

Kinda leans back on the table with a somewhat cocky expression despite [expletive] on his own product.

Bard: She gonna hesitate and just kind of sit quietly.

Thief: I turn to the lady next to me and I say in Elvish, "Len sulion.  Then I translate, "It means I greet you or hello. My name is Rafros, what is yours," and I glare over at the barkeep for being so rude/ But don't really say anything to him.

DM: He kinda smiles and rolls his eyes. Training his one finger.

Bard: I'm just gonna look over to the elf sitting next to me and just like, "Ah, good to meet you. I'm Harmony."

Thief: "Hello, Harmony. Have you ever been to this place. I've heard of it but never actually saw it."

Bard: [messes with her hands a bit ]. Hesitantly speaks, "No I haven't been in this city too long.

Thief: "Same here."

DM: The bartender cackles at the word of city, "Heh, city." [shakes his head].

Thief: "You know you have the manners of an Orc. I know, I was captured by Orcs and they don't have good manners. "So tell me bartender, which do you recommend... the horse piss or the pig swallow?"

DM: He looks into the Air. Thinks for a moment. "Well, I know you knife ears can't really handle your boozed." He kinda reaches under the counter. You hear a pouring of liquid, brings up a  very pale, almost water down ale, " I recommend this for you." He looks back over the lady, " Have you decided yet?"

Bard: "No, I won't be having anything here. Thank you."

DM: "Waist of time." He kinda looks back at his one finger kinda glancing over at the two you every now and then.

Bard: Seems this was a waist of time. Harmony is gonna get up and move to the other table.

Thief: My character is going to move over... waves at Harmony for a second and go over to Mila, and strike up a conversation with her.

DM: You approach Mila and she kinda looks over at you, a pleasant smile crack on her faces as a stranger approaches her, "Oh, why hello there sir, are you here to trade?

Thief: "Well that depends, would you happen to have anything worth my while?"

DM: "Oh, I am not quite sure what you'd be looking for sit. I mean, I have a vast array wares. However, of course, I don't carry them upon my self in such a terrible establishment."

Thief: "I see. Well what about sleepy vine bark or perhaps scintilla beans?"

DM: She murmurers the ingredients kinda looking up thinking if she has that, "Perhaps. Perhaps, do you... she pauses. Perhaps by next dawn we can trade." 

So you guys are aware it is like night, and it is raining, it is very terrible weather. I apologize I did not make that clear. 

"Perhaps by tomorrow we could trade, would that be alright with you? I could definitely look through my wares to night, of course."

Thief: "Certainly."

DM: Real quick could the both of you just shoot me your passive perceptions and passive insight, that would be great.

Bard: Yes.

Thief: You mean like a roll for it?

DM: Yeah you can roll for it this time. I'll allow it since I didn't prepare properly.

Thief: Okay.

DM: Thank you.

Bard: [gasps] I'll roll for it this time. Wait what is my perception? Oh, my goodness.

DM: Now, I will have you make your insight check at disadvantage because you are, way far.

Bard: Ok, so you just want me to do 2d20.

DM: Yeah, 2d20 assuming that you were listening.

Bard: Yeah, I was listening. There were both three apparently.

DM: Well it was meant to be. And... Apologies, what are both of your names? What can I call you guys?"

Bard: In real life?

DM: Yeah.

Bard: Dillon.

Thief: David.

DM: Dillon and David. Ok, sweet. Thank you, those make things easier.

Thief: So do I roll 2d10 as well?  

 DM: No you just roll 1d20, and you add your insight. 

Thief: +2 and that would be a total of 12.

DM: So, hear her words and seems to hold up. I mean it does make sense that a merchant on her time off wouldn't want to trade at the moment. It is a dark and stormy night. She smiles everything seems to be ok.  A few moments pass away... "Oh, are you here for anything else... Buy a poor old woman a drink," she kinda feigns. 

Thief: I motion for the barkeep to bring a drink for the lady.

DM: Mila looks over at you honeydew and kinds gives you that look. You know, just played this fool.

Bard: She's gonna kinda like hesitate for a sec and just kinda like look around and just look back down.

DM: Barlo comes on over meandering... "Mila," stops him self from obscenity, "[sighs], What drink do you want?"

Thief: The lady wants a drink.

DM: She looks at you, "Oh, for me? Oh, how kind."

Barlo scowls and walks back mumbling to himself. Mila looks back over at you, "Did you hear the rumors? People are speaking about snakes and all these monstrous creatures. I've yet to see any. Have you a strong and worthy adventurer, seen any creatures such as this?"

Thief: "No, I haven't. But, I have heard the rumors and felt something strange when I came near this place. I'm not sure what to think about it."

DM: "Oh my, our little town of Dalewatch, I knew I should have settle further south." 

Her movements deliberately dramatic, both of you would be able to pick up on that very easily. You ms honeydew, [unintelligible]. You overhear the woman over here, Lyra, you overhear her screaming something about nightmares as Caldra is trying to calm her down. It seems than know one here int he tavern seems to pay her any mind. But something kinda calls to you.

Bard: I want to listen in. Should I just get closer?

DM: That's up to you.

Bard: I'm  gonna get closer.

DM: Ok. You approach and you hear this old woman babbling. You hear a bunch of slurred words of multiple different languages, all incoherently strung together.  

Bard: Would I know which languages they are?

DM: What languages do you speak?

Bard: Common and Inferno.

DM: Okay, you do not understand what she is saying. Give me an arcana roll.

Dard: 17

DM: Ok, you don't know what she's saying, but you can hear noises akin to what you've read... Abyssal creatures, as well as kinda dialects similar to  what you think a dragon would use. This human woman, looking homely as if she had never left this town.  There's very little chance that she would naturally be able to speak these languages, you deduce. 

You do hear her in common though, and this would got to you Rafros as you approach, Mila just kinda waves you good bye. Understand nightmare and darkness as she's babbling. You see Calda desperately trying to quiet her down.

Thief: Nightmare and  darkness the only thing he could relate to is his time with the Orcs. He's gonna approach even closer, and then try speaking a little bit of Orchish.

DM: "What's that you are saying?" Calda looks up at you, "I'm so sorry sir, I... I didn't realize that she would be bothering everyone like this. Usually her babbling would be much quieter.  She tries to shake Lyra out of her frenzy as she rocks in her chair. You can tell that the Orcish that you speak has little to effect to the way she's acting. Her eyes do follow your appearance, your form, but other than that very little is happening.

Do you speak other languages  out side of...

Thief: I speak Elf and Orc.

DM: Ok, so you do not understand either.

Bard: I'm assuming shes a dragonborn or...

DM: No, she's a human. You do notice however, as Lyra looks around the room, her ramblings get much more violent. As she appears to... Like in the general direction of the family and Mila. The family over here talking amongst themselves, kind of murmuring, you are not quite sure what they are saying. But it does seem to be to the effect that Lyra always does this sort of thing. The parents are trying to shield Sara from the sight.

Thief: I turn to Calda and I ask her, "Do you have any idea what she is saying?" I speak to her in the common tongue.

DM: "I have not idea. I've devoted my life to becoming an apothecary so I could discover any sort of tincture that could cure her. Let her rest at peace for once, it's been so many years. Since I was a child, she's never been right. I just don't under stand."

Thief: I don't think this is a normal affliction. "You say that you are an apothecary?"

DM: "Yes, I do admit that my remedies are rather antiquated. But, it's the best I can muster in this conditions."

Thief: "I see, so. Those people over their at the other table, are they related to you? Do you know them?"

DM: "Over there?"

Thief: "Yes."

DM: "That's Rollin and Cassa, they're lovely people. They are so patient. They're a simple farming folk. Most of our town is composed of them, of course. Outside of that I don't know what much to say.

Bard: Can I roll some kind of arcana check to see if she's afflicted with something?

DM: Yeah, sure. Actually you got a 17\. You would be able to deduce that yes this in deed a nor normal affliction. It does seem to be born of magic. But this magic is very foreign to you. It doesn't feel as it's not arcane or divine. You're a bard correct?

Bard: Yes.

DM: Yeah, you definitely be able to tell that this neither arcane or divine. This is very foreign magic to you. Assuming that your intuition is correct.

[Discussion about UI controls for rolls]

Bard: Can I make an arcana check and maybe glean some more information?

DM: I don't see why not.

Bard: [rolls dice]

DM: You do know she is speaking about, around Abyssal and Draconnic. You can kinda deduce that maybe what's she saying is maybe a bit weird. You; however, aren't really able to pick up on the fineries of the magic though.

Thief: I tell Calda, "I think you might need a priest. Or maybe even wizard, I don't know. But since you are an apothecary..."

DM: "Father Aldric tried."

Thief: "Oh, he did and he didn't succeed?"

DM: "Unfortunately the warmth of [Pelor](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=18) hasn't reached Dalewatch. Very cold and nightmarish land this is."

Bard: Can I go over to the other table and ask them?

DM: You can ask whatever you want.

Bard: I go over here and greet them and be like, "Hello, I'm Harmony. I was kind listing in on the conversation over there and the Calda woman said she knew you guys."

DM: "Well I assume as much," Rollin says kind of taken back by both the fact that you are not human nor a farm folk. "I'm just but a humble farmer and so is my wife, Cassa here."

Bard: "Lovely to meet both. Do you happen to know what's going with that elder woman there, why she so..."

DM: "Oh," he kinda eyes, "Well Lyra over there has been afflicted by some sort of [unintelligible] since I was child even. Poor Calda has been trying to remedy with her, only tinctures mind you. And I'm but a simple farmer. But, I have notices that any time there were  ruts or any sort of patterns in the ground that I don't normally see, she seems to babble more than usual. This is... seems to be more one of the worst fits she's had in a long while." 

Kind of looks over at Mila for a second and then looks back at you, "I believe that the appearance of certain people have been making her worse."

Bard: Is he looking at me weird when he says that?

DM: No he your are able to deduce he is talking about Mila.

Bard: "So who is that woman over there?"

DM: Are you referring to Mila?

Bard: Yes.

DM: "Mila says that she is some sort of trade woman or whatever. But I have yet to see her sell a damn thing. She's always saying that she might plan on opening shop soon. But, it's been weeks since I've seen anything, and I rarely see her leave her house. And... Quite frankly there's a foul stench that emanates from there."

Bard: "Hmm, I just watched her just try to scam that young man over there."

DM: "She often does to new adventurers and anyone who passes through this hellhole of a town."

You see Cassa kinda sit there reserved, she doesn't seem to be offended or scared or anything but, she kinda just hides away in the corner to the sight of you. Sara seems to be enthused by the appearance of a odd creature... no offence, in the town.

Bard: Is she like looking at my horns or something?

DM: Yeah.

Bard: I'm gonna like kneel down in front of here be like, "You'd like to touch?"

DM: You see her kind of start reaching her hands out. You see Rollin give a glare at you as her hands get closer.

Bard: I'm just gonna let it happen.

DM: Alright. Sara grabs your horns and kinda like giggles and kinda like takes her hands off as if it's like the newest thing since sliced bread. She kinda like, does whatever children do kind of just like [expletive] back to the other side of the bench after a little bit.

Thief: Did my character hear the conversation she's having over there at the table?

DM: If you'd like assuming your character would actually be able to hear it.

[banter]

DM: Ok, real quick. I like playing with the idea of do you think your character could realistically do X? If you think he can, then there's reality to what you are saying. Then I am ok with it 99 percent of the time.

Bard: It depends if Lyra is still babbling or not.

DM: Oh, she is definitely babbling, she will not stop babbling for this entire time.

[banter]

DM: Apologies. But I also want to clarify because, me as a player I hate this. If you have an ability, you know how to use it, you're confident in you ability to use the ability. You do not need to read the ability to me. Unless I ask. The reason I say that is 'cause I get real sick and tired of hearing someone talk about fireball every five minutes.

[more banter]

DM: That's all I gotta say, continue.

Thief: Ok, since he is thief. Part of his profession is kinda listen to people. But with Lyra babbling so close to him, it might be difficult to hear. Maybe a perception check to if I can even work through it.

DM: Go for it.

Thief: [rolls dice]  Ooo, I rolled a 9.

DM:  Oh, it is yikes. Yeah, unfortunately you're not really able to hear anything of substance due to Lyra kind of babbling and Caldra, trying to calm her down. 

Thief: So I talk to Caldra and say, "Since you're and apothecary would you have access to certain things. I'm looking for something and I'm getting a little bit suspicious of that one there in the corner. I'm look for some sleeping vine bark or perhaps some scintilla beans."

DM: "Sleepy vine bark I mean... That is kind of... That is uncommon and I as much as I would love to pawn that off... It can make some very powerful tinctures you know. " She kinda thinks for a moment, "I,,, Maybe... Maybe if you come back tomorrow I can see what I can do for you."

Thief: "Alright. What do you know about that woman in the corner?

DM: "Oh, Mila?" She kinda rolls her eyes trying to maintain composure, "She's  a character, she... just appeared in town one day and said she was a trader. I haven't seen her trade a damn thing. Of course I'm usually cooped up in my own little world. But, I hear very similar tales quite often and, between you and I, it seems as if somethings be getting quite strange after her appearance. I'm not quite sure what to to make of it."

Thief: "Yeah, I've been feeling something strange I can't put my finger on it, she told me of strange happenings. What do you know about it?"

DM: "Strange happenings I mean... People talk..."

Thief: "Something about snake people.

DM: "Unfortunately this is a very small town, people out here just like telling stories to make sense of the world around them. Yeah an occasional creature will come by and snatch a child and that's that. But... These tails of fantastical creatures it's just..."

Thief: "You said a creature snatching children?"

DM: "Well, I mean, look at us we're in the middle of nowhere."

Thief: "Has anybody witness one of these snatchings?"

DM: He kinda ponders, "Hmm, no not real... Not that I am aware of, frankly it's not something that's often talk about. People like to shun that away. But, I can say that there are some rather unfortunate gentlemen that do take up residence near this town and, unfortunately the like to extort our people. They, you know, they take our belongings steal from us, kill our livestock and drag them away, and sometimes I think people want to cope with that by saying it's a snake."

Thief: "Interesting. Well I than you for your time, and perhaps I will talk to you in the morning about what I am looking for."

DM: "Oh, oh of course. Feel free to stop by and... " She'll tell you kinda tell you a general location of where here 'lil hut is. I think I have that on the map that I'll bring you guys to.

Thief: Alright, so I'm gonna get up an go over to Harmony, and try not to be presumptuous and sit across from her. And say, "Well, learned some interesting things about what's going on here. What do you make of it?"

Bard: "I make that these people don't see much around here. Everything is very strange around these parts."

Thief: "Yes..."

Bard: "Seems like these people don't know as much, either that or they're not letting on as much as they do know."

Thief: "Could be, we are strangers after all. So what did those people tell you about the woman in the corner? Mila I think she's called,"

Bard: "Apparently she only just came in recently. But since she came in the babbling lady over there has been babbling a lot more. A lot more than normal."

Thief: My character is going to try and keep an eye on Mila, and without trying to be noticed that he's doing it. And when she leave he's gonna follow her through the shadows.

DM: Really now? 

Thief: Mm hmm.

DM: Uh oh. A little bit of time passes, maybe about five, ten minutes. I don't know if you Harmony are planning  on doing anything in that time or if you are Rafros. 

Bard: I just play my lute a little bit I guess. No particular thing just in general just playing it to play it.

Dm: Yeah... You start playing your lute, if you like to give me a performance that'd be great.

Bard: For sure. [rolls dice] I got a 16.

DM: You play fine, Melody. It's that kinda picks up the atmosphere despite the overly dreary outlook everyone has, and you guys hear the sound of a bell out side ring frantically. The door slams, a man runs into the tavern. You see a man in priestly robes, a sigil of  [Pelor](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=18) attached to a necklace attached to his neck. His breath is labored as he just ran inside.

"Those damn boys," he says. He looks around, "I think they've killed another.

You see Barlo stand up, his relaxed demeanor changing frantically.

(as priest) "Please, please we need people to look for them!"

You see Barlo kinda run over, "What... What happened?" 

That'll be your cue.

Thief: My character comes over, "What give priest?"

Bard: Yeah, so does mine.

DM: What did you say?

Thief: May character says, "What gives priest?" There's a bit of a tone there because he doesn't believe in any of the gods but, he's trying to be respect with out being to overly obnoxious about it.

Bard: Demeaning.

Thief: Yeah.

DM: "I was just informed that they found a young woman slaughtered by the road. Someone saying the bandits did it."

Thief "Where?"

DM: "Follow me." The priest starts quickly walking out. Barlo looks at the two of you, "What the hell am I suppose to do?"

Thief: I follow.

[non-game pause]

## Session 1 Scene 2 At the body on the road

DM: You guys follow father Aldric. Oh magic... In the distance you see a group of men with torches. You hear dogs barking and as you guys get closer you see a large bloodied pulp. A woman lies there her body ripped to shreds. For those who are more keenly acute you notices that her ribs are like splayed out of her.

Bard: Blood eagle.

DM: It's very similar concept. As you approach closer you realize her body is indeed hollowed. Both of you... No never mind. Father Aldric moves up, Here she is. I don't know what to say. " 

You see a bunch of men kind of looking around for any remnants of clues on where these men could have gone. 

Thief: "Did anybody see what happened?"

DM: One of the men piped up, "No I didn't see anything. I was just walking down the trail as I usually do trying to get down to the tavern and I just found her here. I... I don't know what to do."

Thief: Ok, I'm gonna start looking around for tracks that aren't human.

Bard: I am too. 

DM: Do you guys start looking for tracks?

Bard: Yeah.

Thief: Yes.

DM: Give me investigation rolls.

[dice rolls]

Bard: I got an 11.

DM: Ok.

Thief: And I got a 10\. No actually I got a 20.

DM: You got a 20 it's 17 + 3 I believe. 

You guys notice that there are not tracks whatsoever. Do... Paraphrase, there are not tracks aside from her own. You notice that her tracks are spread far apart as if she was running. And she was running towards town. Out side of that, there seems to be very little. A faint trail of blood does lead along those tracks, however. But there are not footprints of any other creature aside from her. 

Bard: Can I follow her tracks to see where she was running from?

DM: Yes. Gimme a second because Patrick is here.

[pause to allow new player into the game]

DM: You guys do realize aside from her footsteps running toward town there are really no other signs of any creature. You notice the dogs don't eve pick up on a scent. As they are sniffing around helplessly for any sign. And all kinda stand around looking like bumbling fools as they don't really know how to look for clues such as this. Father Aldric kinda looks at you two with pleading eyes, a question silently asked.

Bard: I'm gonna follow the footsteps from where she came from.

DM: Alright. What about yourself, Mr. Rafros? What do you do?

Thief: I'm gonna follow behind her but I'm going to be looking on the ground looking for any other signs of disturbance on the ground. But keeping and eye and ear out for whatever. So do I need to roll more for investigation?

DM: Nope not yet.

Thief: Ok.

[game pause]

Note: The DM decided to retcon the joining player/character into the previous scene at The Dusty Mug so the new character a Half-Dow wizard knows what has happened up to this point. The scene picks up after the pause with the new character.

DM: The three of you follow the track hastily into the woods. You guys see kinda trail formed just from general usage. As you guys will see a big splot of blood here.

Wizard: I'll go over and check over here.

DM: As you walk through can all of you guys give me a perception check?

[dice rolls]

Thief: Yuk.

Wizard: I got a good perception.

DM: Yeah, I noticed.

Bard: I got 13.

Bard: I almost fumbled that.

DM: You Dinver as you are moving through this forest you see a odd figure kinda stalcking through the branches over here. It's a little bit further in the tree line and it's blending in really well but your able to see through the shadows. Kinda get a glimpse of something moving.

Wizard: I tell the group, "Hey there's somebody over there. Over by the bushes over here."

Thief: Well I have dark vision and I can probably see it and I ready my bow.

DM: Despite your dark vision...

Wizard: I have dark vision up to 60 feet.

DM: Despite your dark visions, this creature is blending in expertly. It, I mean without... I don't know how to explain this, someone with dark vision. It's as if you don't have dark vision while looking at this creature.

[unintelligible]

DM: Yes, they're camouflaged very well. As you move up Dinver you see four bluish green eyes slowly open as you approach. All of you roll initiative.

As you see a large spindly creature composed of chiton and very odd features rise out of the ground. 

[pause to explain vtt app]

## Session 1 Scene 2.5 Fight with something Ugly

DM: You guys ready yourselves as you see this creature rise. I'm actually going to give you guys all a free round of action against this creature. It is not a surprise round but, it is a free round as it start rising out of the debris. It is a very large creature and it's very hard to see, despite it being directly in front of you. It will go from you Rafros to Patrick, to you Ms. Harmony. 

Thief: Ok, my character utters an expletive in Orc and fires a shot. [rolls attack]

[pause for to work out interface]

[rolls natural 20]

DM: Like I said with critical damage your first set of dice are maxed and you roll a second set of dice. So for you since you don't have your sneak attack it'd be your 1d8, so 8 plus your plus your dex modifier plus 1d8.

Thief: Well it says damage is 1d6 + 3\. So that would be it.

DM: Oh, ok. I assumed it...

Thief: Right, and then an additional die?

DM: Yeah, so it's 1d6 + 3 since it's critical it's 9 + 1d6.

Thief: Plus 1d6.

DM: Yup.

Thief: [rolls 1d6], Ooof.

DM: Better than nothing. You hit the creature squarely, your arrow penetrating deep into it's chiton. But it seems repetitively unfazed by your arrow as it slowly stands up. Will that be the end of your turn?

Thief: Well, I don't have sneak attack. I think I'm going to if I can move into the shadows.

DM: You are going to try move and hide?

Thief: Yes.

DM: Yeah, I mean anywhere in the tree line you can try to find a spot to hide. That's ok with me.

Thief: There, I think.

DM: Give me a roll for your hide.

Bard: Stealth.

DM: Yes, your stealth. Sorry, stuck in 3.5.

Thief: [rolls stealth] Yuk.

DM: You think you're hiding very well.

Alright, Patrick. I assume it's your turn now. 

Wizard: Yup. I look up. I look at him, you see me reach into my pocket and I pull out some kind of powdery substance, and I rub my hands together in a circle-like type formation, and I will cast firebolt.

[banter about the firebolt spell]

DM: Your firebolt hits him squarely; however, you notice that despite hitting him his chiton deflects the bolt and absorbs the energy.  [unintelligible]

Wizard: I didn't hit him?

DM: Nope.

Wizard: [expletive] Ok, in my bonus action I'm going to cast Misty Step and get the [expletive] out of the way.

[banter]

Wizard: And that is my turn.

DM: Alright. Miss Melody it's your turn.

Bard: Alrighty. I'm going to pull out my lute. I kinda just stare at it for a moment. I play a tune, I do a little strum and I cast Thunder Wave.

DM: Where you at right now?

Bard: How close am I to it?

DM: You are about 25 feet away.

Bard: Ok, so it's a creature within a 15 foot cube, so the rest of us should be fine because we are all away from it. If it hits it gets pushed 10 feet away. Oh creature within a 15 foot cube originating from me.

DM: Yep.

Bard: That's boring. Give me one second let me think about this.

[banter about the weather in the game]

Bard: Then I will cast Dissonant Whispers on it.

DM: Ok, what I give you a saving throw, correct?

Bard: Yes. It makes a Wisdom saving throw.

DM: A Wisdom saving throw you say?

Bard: Yes.

DM: Does a 14 work for you?

Bard: Oh, save DC. What did you say it was?

DM: 14

Bard: That is my save DC. 

DM: Since you are a player. So meet means for players, meet rhymes with defeat for that.

Bard: Ok, so he doesn't save?

DM: Yeah, he fails.

Bard: Ok. Alright, then he will take 3d6\. [rolls damage dice]

DM: It was psychic damage correct?

Bard: Yes. Takes 5 damage, that is the worst [unintelligible] rolls. I got a 1 a 2 and a 2.

DM: That is unfortunate I am sorry. You cast Dissonant Whispers, you see the creature kind of wince, annoyed by the effect. But it doesn't seem to be impeded much.

Alrighty, the start of the next round. The creature rises and slowly makes its way towards.

[back and forth talking]

DM: Even or odd... Rafros.

Thief: Me? Let's go odd.

DM: Odd, dang. Unfortunately the creature goes towards you.

Thief: Oh boy.

DM: Sorry man. A deep croaking noise happens and give me a an Intelligence saving throw.

Thief: [rolls dice] Oh my god!

DM: Did you roll a nat 1.

Thief: Yeah.

[back and forth about bad rolls]

DM: Ok, you feel your mind scream at you. It appears as if millions of people are whispering at you all at once. You are going to take. Oh yikes! How much HP do you have?

Thief: 15

DM: Oh!

Thief: Am I going into a pillar fire. [laughs] Can I cry out to the gods I don't believe in to save me?

DM: Wow. I rolled exceptionally well. You take 20 points of psychic damage.

Bard: Yeesh!

Thief: Ok, what is psychic damage?

DM: Psychic damage is like, the best way I can explain it is like, your mind frying. Like something so potent that your body... that your mind literally can not handle it. So your mind shattered to the point where you pass out.

[back and forth about damage and mechanics]

DM: You hear a laugh as he falls to the ground his corps whimpering as he is rocking, murmuring, babbling, similar to how the old woman was in fact. And the creature looks over at you and starts making its way slowly. Walking confidently towards you. 

Bard: To me?

DM: Yep. Alright, Patrick it is your turn.

Wizard: Ok, enough's enough. I am going to reach in my pocket. I grab a metal coin out of my pocket. I swerve it in my hand and I clap real quick and I fire Witch Bolt at him. [rolls attack dice] 17 hit?

DM: Yes it does. You hit the creature squarely, the Witch Bolt sticking to him. Give me your damage my good sir.

Wizard: [rolls damage dice] 29.

DM: [expletive] My boy ain't playing.

Wizard: Like I said enough's enough.

DM: You hit him squarely. This Witch Bolt, what type is, it's lightning?

Wizard: Yep.

DM: You see his body convulse.  And he takes a step back, kinda taken aback by this. He seems very hurt, but he is still not dead.

Bard: I don't like that.

Wizard: That's it because I don't have any other bonus actions.

DM: Is your turn. Melody. 

Bard: Ok. I am going to... I will do... I'll do Dissonant Whispers again.

DM: Ok. 

[back and forth about the spell being cast]

DM: Despite your best attempt with Dissonant Whispers, he does not seem to be affected. 

Bard: Yeah, ok. 

[back and forth about dice rolls]

DM: He is going to make a claw attack at you. [rolls attack dice] Dude. Does a 19 hit?

Bard: It does. As a reaction I'm gonna use hellish rebuke. 

DM: Alright.

Bard: At a 2nd level. 

DM:  Ok. 

Bard: And that is 15 damage.

DM: You are slashed deeply for 6 points of damage. But as he slashes you and you release your hellish rebuke. The creature is... You see him convulse from the fire, and he falls to the ground, dead.

Bard: Cool!

DM: You watch as his body turns to ichor and melts into the ground as if he had never been there. 

Bard: He turns to what?

DM: Ichor. Imagine in this example. Imagine kind of like blackish blood.

[back and forth about what ichor is]

DM: Kind of like black tree sap. It kinda just like flows into the ground as he dies.

Bard: Gross.

DM: The entirety of the forest is silent now, aside from your teammate over here who is babbling uncontrollably.

Bard: Ok, can I go and cure wounds on him?

DM: Absolutely.

Bard: I'm gonna do that, at a 2nd level. He will get 22 health back.

[back and forth about healing]

[fumbling with interface]

Thief: May character in the Elven tongue says, "What the eff just happened?"

Bard: I don't know but I wanna go up to the body,

DM: Where the body was?

Bard: Yeah.

DM: Alright, you go over to where his corpse would have lied and you see nothing. It's as if he was never there. All you see are the tracks of yourselves and your own blood splattered across the ground from his slash. Outside of that there has not been a single disturbance that has been made by him.

Bard: I don't like that... Can I check my own blood?

DM: Sure, I won't even have you roll for it. It is your own blood. Nothing really special about anything going on there, aside that is in a pattern as if someone got slashe by a massive claw.

Bard: That's crazy.

DM: I know. I know. Other than that. For those who are inquiring what else is happening here. You guys see undulations in the ground. That kind of lead as if something something slithering down this way. [unintelligible] in the ground, the grass kind of like tampered down, and you also see a large pool of blood here as if someone was brutally assaulted from you can presume to be the woman.

Bard: I wanna follow the undulations.

Wizard: I'm gonna go over here and make a perception check.

Thief: Yeah.

DM: Ok. You guys go up to where the undulations are and...

Wizard: [rolls dice]

DM: Jesus Patrick man, I haven't seen a roll this low in forever.

Wizard: I know, I don't normally roll this good.

DM: Like I'm not gonna hold y'all. Y'all were supposed to see the one guy, bye the way. But, you study the undulations along with everyone else. It seems rather clear that this is a massive, massive snake. The best you could deduce this to be is an absolutely inordinately massive snake. And no one has to roll for this, it is very clear that a creature of that size and of that variety would have no place in this area.

Thief: Do I remember what happened to me?

DM: All you remember from being hit is just an obscene amount of whispering voices and languages you are unable to understand. The only things you are able to pick up on were darkness and moon.

Thief: Darkness and moon, interesting.

Bard: Is it still moving or is it just still?

DM: So the undulations...

Thief: It's just a snake trail.

DM: Yeah, it's just a snake trail. That's all it is.

Wizard: I look at the other, "You guys wanna follow this?"

[the party agrees]

Thief: "What the hell was that?" Referring to the creature the just fought.

DM: None of you guys have ever seen a creature like that before. If you guys would like to make a history check to see if you would know.

Bard: I'll do it.

Wizard: Yeah, I'll do it to why not.

Thief: Yeah might as well, I'll do it.

[dice rolls]

Wizard: Jesus Christ!

Bard: [giggles] I got a 23.

Thief: I got a 13.

Wizard: I got a 21.

DM: So, sorry Rafros but you do not know anything of anything to do with these creatures. The players with 21 and 23, you guys are not entirely sure what that was. The only thing you could really equate that to was maybe some sort of Abyssal creature with a reptilian background.

Wizard: Would my mom maybe had told me anything about it?

DM: No. This is a very obscure creature and it just really has no place in any of the history books you have read. And that also goes for you Harmony, despite your college training.

Thief: And the Orcs he was captured by wouldn't know anything. My dead elf mother probably not either.

DM: Whatever this thing was either there are just very little demarcations of this ever even existing, and the little that you might have heard about it's non conclusive at best.

Bard: Yeah I wanna follow where these trails are going.

DM: Ok, so you want to follow the undulations?

Bard: Yes sir.

## Session 1 Scene 3 The Big Snake

DM: You guys follow this trail for what feels like hours. You guys are moving through the wilderness the darkness just as cold as the rain. You guys off in the distance you see a snake, darker than the night it self. It's body a void amongst a silhouette of the night sky. It is a massive creature. For a general estimate you guy would speculate that its head alone is about the size of the creature you just recently fought.

Wizard: Holy [expletive]! 

Bard: Yeesh.

Thief: My character is rethinking his life choices at this moment.

DM: You see the snake scan the [unintelligible] and its eye peer at you in a peircing blood red gaze. Fixated on your bodies, staring hungrily.

Thief: Is my darkvision any help with seeing this creature better.

DM: I'm giving you enough distance to where I would say no.

Thief: Ok.

Wizard: I'm going to turn around to Shadow and I'm gonna summon him back to his pocket plane.

DM: Ok. Real quick are you guys preparing to fight him?

Wizard: I was just get her out of the way so she don't get hurt.

Bard: So it's looking right at us right?

DM: Yes. It is a good few hundred feet away. But it is a massive creature and it sees you.

Thief: It's outside of my bow range. I say we try and I don't know, run?

Wizard: Probably a good idea to run from this thing.

Bard: Can I minor illusion a sound so that it can not be fixed directly on us?

DM: Yeah, you can try. What do you do?

Bard: I'm gonna minor illusion a scream behind it. [reminds herself out loud the spell desciption]. I'm just gonna minor illusion a scream behind it and then I'm going to turn around, and grab whoever's there next to me and run back. At least a little bit and then kind of maybe hide behind a tree.

DM: You cast your minor illusion and a scream is heard behind the creature. It does not seem to notice that minor illusion. It's body vibrates and you can feel the entirety of the forest shake. As you run you can hear the loud slithering noises move in you general direction. 

Wizard: Oh [expletive]!

DM: Do the rest of you guys run?

Bard: Who is next to me?

Thief: The wizard, the half-drow.

Bard: Alright, I grab the wizard's hand and I run.

Wizard: I run with her [expletive] this [expletive]

Thief: Yeah, discretion is the better part of valor.

DM: Yes. There's no shame. I'm glad you guys didn't want to fight this. You guys are running for your lives. As the vibration of the forest starts to quiet down. The creature bored of chasing its prey, you. You are now left in the dark of this forests its undulations leading either way. Back where you came or back towards the creature itself. 

Wizard: Let's go back to where we came from.

Bard: Maybe we can get more people.

Thief: Yeah, lets go back to town.

Bard: Tell them what we saw at least. So they're not just you know being afraid of something they don't know what it is.

Thief: And we need to talk to that priest. 

DM: You guys... Do you guys start heading back?

Bard: Yes.

DM: You mo

ving you way back and you end up back at the same point the pool of blood glistening in the moon light. 

Thief: The pool of blood where the woman was at is glistening?

DM: No, the pool of blood on this map right here with the little red lines. I hope you guys see the lines right?

Bard: Yeah the red ones.

DM: It's shimmering from the light of the moon. Large pool of blood...

Thief: Oh it's shimmering.

DM: Yeah, I would say it's like glistening. It's like, light reflects off of it.

Bard: Ok, so it's not magical in anyway.

DM: Not that you're aware of.

Wizard: I'm gonna walk over [unintelligible], and I'm gonna perception check, and I'm gonna look another set of eyeballs.

Bard: I was gonna roll arcana check.

DM: [unintelligible] roll me a perception check and/or investigation 'cause you are a wizard.

Wizard: There we go! There's my rolls. 

Bard: I got a 19.

DM: It is not magic.

Wizard: I got a 7, my rolls are back.

[banter]

Thief: I might as well check it out too.

DM: Mr. Epic fail, you see a pool of blood. Give me that roll Rafros.

Thief: [rolls dice] 

DM: You investigate and this pool of blood you can tell that it arcs in a similar direction like towards where the woman's body was found, and along with that you find your self. You find a bloody torn out part of a note that looks like that.

[banter]

DM: With your investigation roll you are able to tell that a part of the note is written with the blood on the ground in front of you.

Bard: Who is doing this?

DM: Rafros.

Thief: Ok. So I inform everyone what I notice.

Bard: Would we recognize the language of this at all?

DM: Mr. Wizard what languages do you know?

Wizard: I have Common, Dwarvish, Elvish, and Halfling.

DM: Oh, ok. No.

[back and forth about the note]

Thief: I wanna take a sample of the blood, but I don't want to touch it. 

[banter]

Thief: I look around for something to collect the sample.

DM: You're looking around for something to collect the sample with?

Thief: Yeah, I mean I've got a dagger but... I guess I can just use my dagger.

DM: What you looking for a container?

Thief: Oh, well something to put it on. So I don't have to touch it.

DM: Oh, you just want to find something to not touch the blood with. 

Thief: Right.

Bard: I'm sure there's plenty of sticks and leaves and [expletive].

DM: I mean you could just probably use your dagger. I'm not gonna like punish you for [expletive] collecting blood and not trying to touch it. Give me a roll though. Gimme a Dex roll just for fun.

Thief: A Dex roll, ok. [rolls dice]

DM: [unintelligible] Ok, yeah you're good. Yeah, you easily collect a fair bit of blood with your dagger. What do you put it in, like a vial or...

Thief: No I don't have a vial.

Bard: I don't have any, I only have my water skin. Don't touch it.

Thief: I guess I could put it back in it's sheath, but that would kinda mess things up.

DM: How are you gonna try and [unintelligible] this?

Thief: Put it on some leaf and try and fold the leaf up into some other leaves. Kinda bind it together. Or maybe a piece of bark.

Wizard: I will give him a couple piece of my parchment, He can wrap it in.

DM: Ok, that would work a lot better. Write down like poor blood sample.

[back and forth about the blood sample]

DM: So you guys know, what is the plan?

Bard: I don't know, I'm gonna start walking back.

Thief: Yeah, I say we go back to the Dusty Mug.

DM: Alright, you guys gonna start heading back to the Dusty Mug?

Wizard: Yes.

## Session 1 Scene 4 Back at the Dusty Mug

DM: You guys enter back into the tavern and you see Barlo and Father Aldric arguing. You also notice, apologies I honestly did not think anyone's gonna come back here so soon, that Mila is not here any more. You also notice that Lyra is babbling in such a manner like, it is ten fold to what it was earlier. She is rocking violently and screaming at this point. Calda trying to calm her down but it is futile. 

Thief: Ok, I'm gonna go over here to these guys [Barlo and Father Aldric].

Bard: I'm gonna go up here to her. Can I understand anything that she's saying?

DM: You hear a mix of languages and darkeness as it's prime focus and nightmare. Darkness and nightmare. 

Bard: What are her hands doing?

DM: Her hands are trembling aside from that, they are almost vegetative. She not willingly moving them.

Bard: I'm gonna get up next to her and grab her hands for moment and just kind of look at her.

DM: There seems to be no change in the way that she's acting. Her eyes merely dart at you real quick, and then resume a forward glazed [unintelligible].

Bard: I'm gonna just try and get something to her. I'm gonna try and just like, "Lyra, lyra it's okay. Can you tell me if you've seen a creature recently?"

DM: You get no response. 

Wizard: I'm gonna walk up to her and grab her other hand that she's not holding, and I am going to cast as a cantrip Message, and tell her, "Everything is ok you can calm down."

DM: Not a single response, as if nothing had happened. In fact, give me an arcana roll.

[back and forth]

DM: You don't know how, it seems as if that the message cantrip you casted on her was blocked. As if you message did not reach her mind.

Rafros, on to you real quick. You see father Aldric arguing vigorously. They're both yelling at each other. Barlo talking about how it has to be these strange occurrences must be something of like demonic light, and father Aldric yelling back at him saying it's those damn hooligans they're the ones who are causing this.

Thief: I say, "You are both wrong."

DM: The both look at you their lips trembling after the argument. "What do you mean? What did you see out there?"

Thief: I relate what happened and what we saw, what we just ran from.

Bard: I'm gonna go up to them as well and show them my wound. Where did I get slashed at?

DM: I would say it's an arm, like a nice arm cut.

Bard: Alright, I'll show them my arm.

DM: Father Aldric looks at the cut in your arm, "No that's... That's not... Must been an animal."

Bard: "This definitely was not an animal."

Thief: I try to describe the animal or creature whatever it was.

DM: He looks at you in utter disbelief. 

Bard: I'm also gonna say, "It did to Rafros what Lyra sounds like. It made Rafros sound like Lyra over there.

DM: Father Aldric leans into you as you say that, "Between the both of us she's a bumbling fool."

Bard: "Yeah, well Rafros also sounded like a bumbling fool when he was attacked by it."

Thief: "She was probably attacked by it some how."

DM: "Lies."

Bard: You know what, now that I think about it can I go an cure wounds on her?

Thief: Who said lies.

DM: You know that wouldn't work, and Father Aldric said that.

Wizard: Can I cast Detect Magic?

DM: Go for it.

Wizard: I'm casting Detect Magic.

DM: On? It's a radius right?

Wizard: Lyra.

DM: Hold on. Detect Magic, I'M pretty sure it's like a radius thing.

Wizard: Yeah, 30 foot radius.

DM: Ok, gimme a second. [thinking out loud] You cast Detect Magic and you can tell that there is a very odd magical force on Lyra. You are unable to determine what the nature of this magic is. It does not feel either arcane or divine to you and that is very perplexing. However, you are able to tell that, that piece of paper, or you assume that the piece of paper that is being held by Rafros has a very similar magic on it.

Wizard: I go up to Rafros and I say that magic that is around that parchment is the same magic that's around her.

Thief: Ok, I hold up my hand and say, "Just one moment," I turn to the priest and I say, "Mibhachenin!" Basically Elvish for kiss my arse, and then I walk awake and follow the wizard.

DM: You see him scowl but he doesn't say anything back. You guys are able to feel that he knows that there's clearly something going on, he doesn't want to admit it. And the both of you head back to Lyra. What about your self Melody?

Bard: I don't have anything that would really be helpful so. I'm going to... are they still yelling at each other or has it died down?

DM: It died down as you guys interrupted them. Barlo now is like returning back to doing whatever he was doing. Pretty much trying to ignore Father Aldric. And Father Aldric just tries walking past him. 

Bard: Ok, I'm gonna go back to Lyra and them.

DM: Ok. You guys now are at Lyra. Lyra is babbling like a [expletive] idiot right now. 

Thief: I'm gonna pull out the note.

DM: You pull out the note, does she see it?

Thief: Yeah, I'll show it to her.

DM: As you bring up the note to her, you can see that her tone changes completely. The babbling stops almost immediately upon seeing this note. For a second she pauses and you notice that her eyes dilate. Almost where there were whites in her eyes are now completely consumed by black. She [unintelligible] her lips trembling and she speaks, "The coiled one rises. It's shadow devours the light." And you see her lips tremble for just second more as you see blood and ichor start running out of her mouth.

Bard: "Rafros put it away! Put it away!"

Thief: Yeah, I put it away.

DM: You put the note away but it is too late. You notice that the blood continues to stream out of her. Her nose now leaking, you notice that her fingertips are leaking blood and ichor. Similar to the creature you fought earlier and you see her collapse to the ground. 

Bard: I'm gonna call for the father. What's his name again, Father what?

DM: Father Aldric.

Bard: Alright I'm gonna just yell for Father Aldric.

DM: Calda starts screaming frantically, "What did you do? She like freaking the hell out. You see Rolling and Cassa leave quickly, taking Sara out with her seeing anything. And Father Aldric runs over to see this unholy look on Lyra. 

Bard: Can my Cure Wounds her now?

DM: You can, yes. But it won't do any thing.

Bard: Then I won't do it I guess. 

[back and forth about the spell Cure Wounds]

[back and forth about the creatures the party encountered]

Bard: So, Im gonna tell the father that she said something about the coiled one, and I'm gonna be like, "We weren't lying. How would we come up with something like that?"

[back and forth about the creature that was fought.]

DM: As you speak those words, the coiled one. He kinda looks at you strangely, "What does that even mean?"

Wizard: I look at the father and say, "Big [expletive] snake."

Bard: "That's exactly what we told you we saw."

Thief: Detect Magic is there a duration or is it just like instant?

Wizard: 10 minutes.

Thief: 10 minutes say, "I there magic on this note?" I don't actually pull out words just in case. It's like a magical scroll that unleashes itself to people who look at it too close. 

Wizard: I can tell where he's got it right?

DM: Yeah. I mean you'd be able to detect the magic is still active yes.

Wizard: "Yeah, it's still active."

DM: You're not really able to determine how the magic is born, however it is more like a sealing magic I will say, than anything else.

Wizard: Can I do an arcane check on it?

DM: Would you like to investigate it?

Wizard: Yeah.

DM: Absolutely, would Rafros like to give the note to you?

Thief: Sure if he asks for it he can have it. I mean we're all in this together.

Wizard: Yeah, I ask for it I wanna do an arcane check on it.

DM: Ok, gimme a roll.

Wizard: [rolls dice]

Bard: If he fails I'll do an arcane check.

DM: Y'all are wild, passing around.

Bard: The woman just screaming on the floor.

DM: She's no longer screaming. She is chocking on blood and ichor. But it doesn't seem like she is dying. And her murmuring has stopped. Calda is at her aid right now, so you don't have to worry about her too much. 

You give your arcana check and it's a very strange note. What are you trying to look for in specific?

Wizard: Maybe what type of magic it is or if I've read anything from like what my mom had or from what I've read in wizard books I've read.

DM: Because of you knowledge as a wizard and your decent arcane check. You would be able to call some notes that, err... Some pieces of information that kind of allude to this may being some sort of divination magic. As you study the note, give me a will save. 

Wizard: A will save?

DM: Yup.

Bard: Wisdom?

Thief: Oh boy.

DM: Yeah Wisdom.

Wizard: [rolls dice] Ouch!

DM: Your mind flashes with these incoherent memories. But at the end of you memoryscape. As you see all of these visions, the last thing you notice is the sight of a little girl having a dagger getting plunged into her heart. As blood runs into the head of a snake.

Wizard: Wow! I just fall to my knees and try to get my composure back. And I will tell everybody what I've seen. 

Thief: I will interrupt him and speak to him in Elvish, "Don't let the priest know. He won't believe it."

Wizard: I tell back to him.

DM: The priest hearing it the first time 'cause he's right next to you guys.

"I... I don't under stand. I've never heard anything about any of this. What's going on? What did you find out there?"

Wizard: "What we've been telling you. "

DM: He shakes his head in disbelief and sits down on the step, his head light. "I don't know what to make of this."

Bard: "We need to go back out there but I think you should come with us."

Thief: Is this a priest with magic or just a temple bound priest?

DM: You can tell he has a very like, he's a very small town farmer priest.

Bard: So this isn't like a Paladin or Cleric, or something?

DM: No. You're looking at a really old man who is primarily a farmer who puts on priest robes every Sunday.

[banter about the priest]

Bard: I'm just gonna look at him and be like, "The only way we find out more is if we go back out and I think we need to bring more people with us. Including you."

DM: His eyes widen, "What do you think we're gonna do out there?"

Bard: "You will at least see what we're talking about."

DM: He looks around in disbelief by what you are saying. "This so-called snake creature is roaming around our town. We can't do anything about that."

Bard: "So you'd rather just sit here in denial and just pretend nothing's happening?"

DM: "I'd rather get the hell out this town. And I damn well will tell everyone else to do the same."

Wizard: What kind of holy person are you [unintelligible]?"

Bard: "So, yes, you would rather sit here in denial.

Thief: So I simply call him a coward in Orcish.

DM: He hears Orcish and he doesn't understand and he hears someone ask what type of holy person he is and he looks up, "I'm a... I'm a farmer. I believe in my Lord  [Pelor](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=18). But, I can think can't I. I'm not some..."

Wizard: "So is there anybody else in this town that can actually help us? Or you just gonna bow out, puss out and leave?"

DM: "I don't know. It's... This is all too much." He kinda stumbles back to his feet and he looks over at Calda, "We nee to go."

Rafros: Repeats what he says but this time in the common tongue, "Coward."

DM: "Coward yes, but, I want to live. For cripes* sakes Lyra just vomited blood."

*: The actual word said was "Christ" it was edited for realism. A worshiper of  [Pelor](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=18)wold probably not invoke the name of another deity or offspring of one.

Thief: "And what imaginary being do you profess to believe in?"

DM: He looks down in defeat.

Thief: "And what does his teachings tell you?" Basically I am being accusative, doing his atheist thing and, basically ridiculing him for his belief and what the tenets of that belief is supposed to teach him. Seeing if his cowardice goes against any sort of religious belief to bring him back to some sort of. Basically I am trying to intimidate him into being more brave. I can roll an intimidation check if you like.

DM: Give me an intimidation check, go for it.

Bard: You know what? I don't want to talk to this guy any more, I'm going to the bartender. 

Thief: [rolls dice]

DM: 10, despite your words and your ridicule, the priest clenches his fists and looks at Calda, "I'm leaving." And you see him storm out into the night. Unless you try stopping him of course. 

Thief: I just mumble under my breath, "Good riddance to the fraud."

Bard: Yeah, I'm gonna go up to the bartender and try to talk with him.

DM: Barlo looks at you with his eyes being much more soften than before, "By the gods, the hell is happening to the town?"

Bard: "I don't know. But if you know anything. Is there any kind of, I don't know, strong people of this town that could possibly help us?"

DM: He sighs defeated, "Lady, I appreciate your efforts but. I'm the only one whose ever adventured. Anyone else in this town is but a humble farmer, and look at me." He pulls up his hand with the single pointer finger. "I can't do much now that my sword arm is gone."

Wizard: I come up next to her and says, "Is there a town, a bigger town around here somewhere where maybe we would be able to get some more assistance?"

DM: "Not for a... Not for a long while friend it's just... it is..." He kind of takes a while to think, "At least a four weeks travel. By the time you guys leave and come back this town will be gone."

Thief: I have an idea. I turn to the wizard and I speak to him in Elven so that the bartender can't understand and keep my voice low, and ask him if he can make a copy of this note without it being effected. Basically I want a non-magical version of it. 

Bard: A non blood covered parchment?

Thief: Yes.

Wizard: "Yeah I could do that."

Thief: I say, "I know how to get a message to someone." And leave it at that.

Bard: Harmony looks very confused because she can not speak Elvish.

Wizard: I'm gonna walk over her to this table and I'll start copying the note.

Thief: And I tell her, "Sorry about that but I need to keep things on the down low." I whisper in common. "Keep things on the down low I will tell you what the plan is later."

DM: So how are you [unintelligible] this note. Sorry you guys can continue in a sec.

Wizard: I just copy it from basically what I've seen, slowly to...

DM: So are you transcribing, like are you like, cross referencing the note?

Wizard: Yeah. I'm trying to copy it for exact.

DM: Would you say that you are actively looking at said note?

Wizard: Yeah, I'm actively looking and [expletive].

DM: Give me a will save.

Thief: Oh boy.

Wizard: [rolls dice]

[banter]

DM: Your mind is again consumed by these visions. You see the same imagery as you did before, but your mind goes blank for just a moment. You will take 4 points of psychic damage. 

Thief: Oh boy.

Bard: [sighs]

DM: You've been able to jot down a mere, few characters on this part of the note.

Bard: Wait have I seen the note? Have I looked directly at it. No I haven't looked directly at it, but I've seen it right? 

DM: Yes, you've seen it. [unintelligible] the note by it self, you guys will be able to deduce is not like, that by it self is not causing it. It's actively studying it. 

Wizard: Well I'm going to try finish the rest of it, by memory.

Bard: Wait I have... I wanna try something. Can I try and minor illusion the note itself, and see if he can do it without taking, you know psychic damage?

Thief: Now there's an idea.

DM: I mean. I'll allow it.

Bard: Ok, then I cast minor illusion and I'm like, "Here you read this," and I put it in front of him. 

Wizard: "Thank you."

DM: How much have you looked at this note?

Bard: I haven't looked directly at it. I haven't read it up close.

DM: How would you know what the characters look like, may I ask.

Bard: Alright, hang on [unintelligible]. Alright, I'll take the psychic damage just to look at it for a moment. And if I do that then can I minor illusion it in better detail?

DM: So you study the note?

Bard: Yes.

DM: Fantastic, gimme a will save.

Bard: [grunts] [rolls dice] Oh, I got a 6.

DM: You see the same vision as he does; however you do not take the psychic damage. Can you just give me an intelligence roll real quick?

Bard: Just a regular check?

DM: Just a regular, yeah. regular Intelligence check.

Bard: [rolls dice] [unintelligible]

DM: You are able remember what this note looks like pretty well. You are able to make the minor illusion.

Bard: Alright then I minor illusion it in front of all of us.

DM: Ok.

Thief: And I will wrap the note up, fold it up and put it away. And wondering if I should burn the damn thing. 

Bard: No probably not, for now it might need to save it.

Wizard: We might need to put something together with it, or put all the note together.

[banter about note]

Bard: Can we look at my minor illusion without taking...

DM: Yes. Yes you are.

Bard: Awesome. So I'm gonna have Dinver continue to write it all down so that we have another copy of it, so I don't just have to minor illusion it. 

DM: Ok. 

Bard: It is a cantrip so it's not doing anything but..

DM: Nah, I mean it's a good use. 

Thief: Rafros says, "Two copies please. I'm gonna need to send one away."  'Cause I have a way to get a message to someone.

Wizard: I'm gonna to make like, three copies of it.

DM: Yeah, make as many copies as you think you need. Assuming you have the paper of course.

Wizard: Yeah, I do. 

DM: Ok.

[back and forth about equipment and the time we had to make characters]

[back and forth about the way the players played the game]

DM: Alrighty, so you guys copy the note. And you guys sit in a very close to empty [unintelligible, possibly tavern]. The only people left in here are Calda, Lyra who is barely conscious...

Bard: I'm gonna go up to them and ask Calda if she needs help taking Lyra home. 

DM: "No... No, no, it's fine just, please just stay away from her."

Bard: "Ok, I understand." And I'm just gonna walk away.

Thief: Well I'm gonna take a copy of the note and I'm gonna, reverse side I'm gonna scribble a message to my criminal contact. I can basically know how to get messages to and from my contact even over great distances. And I am going to say that something strange is happening in this town. What was the name of this town again.

DM: Dalewatch.

Thief: Dalewatch.

DM: I will let you know. So I know what you are talking about with the criminal contact. Right. This whole thing that you are able to contact someone from a very far distance. Right. I'm trying to think of in it in realistically, I don't foresee. Your character to find away for that though, from here. Unless you can think of something that I can't.

[back and forth discussion]

Wizard: Can you say we did a short rest as we've been sitting there. 

DM: Yeah. I can count this as a short rest for sure.

[more back and forth]

Thief: Well scratch that idea then. I wanna do an arcana check on my copy of the note. And see it any of the symbols I recognize that could match to something that I know. Something familiar. 

DM: Yeah, gimme a check.

Thief: [rolls dice] 18.

[discussion about a possible history check]

DM: 19, the only thing you could really equate this to, like these symbols, the best your mind can comprehend them at this moment is as if they are a mixture of draconic and abyssal. Like each character taking the form of both.

[back and forth]

Wizard: Can I make a history check to see if I read any books [fumbles with words].

DM: Oh divination? Yeah go for it.

Thief: I was thinking more along the lines  a one to one relation with a symbol and a language I do understand, like Elvish.*

*: paraphrased

Wizard: I gotta whoppin 10.

DM: Gimme just a moment with that. I'm trying to thing of what the Elvish language might pertain.

[back and forth]

DM: I'm gonna say no on this one.

Thief: Ok. 

DM: For your divination, what in particular are you [unintelligible] for with divination.

Wizard: Most like, what would cause the mind to get the memories that I was given. 

DM: What type of wizard are you?

Wizard: Evocation.

DM: Evocation, ok. You are not sure. But it does kinda fell like, as if you were seeing into the future. 

Wizard: Ok this might be stupid, I ask for the note back for a minute.

DM: Go for it.

Thief: You got the [unintelligible] original note.

Wizard: No, I want the original note.

Thief: Ok. 

DM: Love this. There is stuff you guys could find out. I like this, this is great.

Wizard: There's a reason why I'm doing it. 

Thief: Ok. I reluctantly hand him the note saying, "Your the wizard."

Wizard: And I'm gonna do another arcana check but I wanna do it where I'm trying to focus more on the memory.

DM & Bard: Oooo.

DM: Ok.

Wizard: More on what the little girl looks like. What the surroundings look like.... huh?

DM: Gimme your arcana check at advantage but your wisdom save at disadvantage. 

[back and forth about ui for DnD beyond]

Wizard: [rolls dice] A 23 and a Wisdom test at disadvantage?

DM: Yes.

Wizard: [rolls dice] [unintelligible]

DM: Ok, you focus your mind as this note pervade your mind. You're able to hear the whispers coalesce into one voice. It's a low growl and all you hear is help from this whisper. As your mind is blackened by this memory.

Wizard: Now the whispers coming from the little girl?

DM: No. We're getting there... You open your eyes to find that you are in the body of this little girl. You look around frantically as you see these humanoid creatures with vague snake-like features. Their tongues forked and their eyes narrowed, their words kinda like to how a snake hisses. You hear then conversate about how they're trying to bring back Mershaulk. You see the dagger and is a very... it's wavy kinda like a falchion, or not flachion a flamberge. You are not able to see this girl for that you are her.

Wizard: Ok.

DM: However, your see the altar very clearly running with blood and black ichor. Give me a perception check.

Wizard: You knew where I was going to. [rolls dice] 25.

DM: You fell or you see. Don't know who she is 'cause you weren't here for that. You see a woman who vaguely looks like Mila. In a robe sitting the a corner of the room. And then your vision fades.

Wizard: Ok. Soon as that ends I am taking out more of my parchment and I'm writing down that name.

Thief: Why don't you write it on the back of the your copy of the note so you don't have to waste more parchment.

Wizard: No, I just grab another piece of paper. I write down that name and I draw what the dagger looks like. And was going to ask was there any symbols on that altar?

DM: Yes, there were symbols on that altar. The symbols are something you do not recognize. However it does appear to be very snake-like, and when you see that symbol I will let you know.

Wizard: Can I draw the symbol with my perception of 25, do I remember it good enough to draw it?

DM: Yes, you will. 

[back and forth DM will message the wizard player about what the symbols will look like}

Wizard: And I draw the symbols off the altar, I draw the dagger, I write the name and then I tell everybody else what I just seen.

Bard: What name are you writing down?

Wizard: How did you pronounce it again?

DM: You saw Mila.

Wizard: No the name I heard.

DM: Oh, Mershaulk

Wizard: Can you send me the spelling of that.

[back and forth spelling put in Discord channel for game]

DM: Go for it, actually give me a religion.

Thief: As a atheist character give you a religion.

DM: I mean, you might have heard stuff. Ok, I'll allow a history, but it will noticeably more difficult of a DC because of how far [unintelligible] would be removed.

Thief: Right. Maybe something from the time of the Orcs might of come to mind. [rolls dice] Oh, yay... [sounding disappointed]

DM: No. First of Orc would have no [expletive] clue about this garbage.

[back and forth]

Wizard: Now do I take any damage from that? [referring to when he was under the influence of the magic from the note]

DM: No, you do not.

Wizard. Oh.

DM: Ok, would you rather take damage?

Wizard: No, no, no I was thinking good, good. I was thinking I was gonna take some kinda amount of damage from that.

[back and forth]

Thief: So my character is kinda thinking out loud here, "So let me get this straight, you saw vision of some nut case cult worshiping or sacrificing someone to some imaginary deity or something like that. Is that what you are telling me?"

Wizard: "Yeah."

Thief: [exasperated] "uh... Boy. Great we're going after psychos. worshiping some evil god."

Wizard: And I tell him about the girl I seen, that looked like the other girl.

[back and forth about Mila]

Thief: I mention about the moon and the darkness*.

*: paraphrased

DM: Would you like me to read off what she said?

Thief: Going back to my recollections of moon and darkness to see if that means anything to anyone.

DM: Anyone?

Wizard: No.

Bard: What was it?

Thief: [Tries to recollect from when he was attacked by the creature]

Wizard: It's pretty much the same thing the other girl was saying. It has something to do with some kind of serpent god or something. Well this might be another stupid question but can I do a history check to see if I read anything about a serpent god.

DM: Sure, gimme a roll.

Wizard: [rolls dice]

DM: You're lying.

[banter]

DM: You can recollect from you readings that long ago, like, long, long ago. Does anyone anything about Forgotten Realms lore?

Wizard: No I don't.

Bard: I don't know anything about anything.

DM: So, no, no, and no?

Thief: No.

DM: Ok.

Bard: I don't know [expletive] about [expletive].

DM: Real, so, you know that long ago, like before, humanoid races were a thing. There was a race of people that worshiped, err a race of creatures that worshiped snakes. Mershaulk happens to be the name of one of those snakes. 

Wizard: I tell them. I know it's a long shot. Going to this other town might lead to more information. 'Cause as it sits right now as us three we can not go back at there. We would not survive. So I'm thinking if we can get more information and more prepared and possibly more help. Our odds might be more in our favor. But as it sits right now us three, we wouldn't survive. 

[back and forth deliberations as Characters]

DM: You see Barlo kinda walk in the back as you guys are talking he walks out with a box full of stuff. He just drops this on the table he looks at all of you guys, "Listen. If you all know how to save our town. I'll give you what I left my adventuring life with." And he opens up the lid. Inside of it is nice bag of gold, which I'll give you the information, just a moment. Six minor healing potions and I will give you guys 1 foxglove. So a faux glove is a home brew item. It is a consumable, as a bonus action you can consume, err as a reaction you can consume a foxglove to get +5 on your next Wisdom saving roll. 

Wizard: Foxglove?

DM: Yes, foxglove it's a type of plant. 

Bard: Oh, that makes more sense. 

Thief: Ok.

DM: Along with that, y'all will find a Tiger Lilly, err you'll each get a Tiger Lilly. That does the same as a foxglove but give you a + to your Constitution saving throws.

Bard: Is it one foxglove or three?

DM: It's three, you'll each get one. You guys can deliberate it further from there. I'm just giving you each one so that... to avoid for time sake.

[back and forth]

Bard: Is there anything else in there?

DM: In the bag of gold is comprised of approximately 560.

Thief: Holy cow!

Bard: Damn!

Thief: I should have robbed this guy earlier.

Bard: Is there anything else in the [unintelligible] box.

DM: From there. I will give you guys any basic mundane equipment that you will need.

[back and forth]

Thief: How about a poisoner's kit or herbalism kit?

DM: Absolutely, I will limit you to one of a kit. Like one of each kit.

[back and forth]

Wizard: Each person get's 186 gold pieces.

[back and forth]

Thief: I think I'm gonna go with a forger's kit.

DM: I will give you guys over the week to get everything down. We're probably gonna end it here for now.

[back and forth]

Bard: I'm gonna take a healer's kit.

DM: Absolutely.

[back and forth]
